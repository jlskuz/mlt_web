## Plugin Information

title: Vid.Stab Detect and Transform  
media types:
Video  
description: Stabilize Video (for wiggly/rolling video)  
version: 2  
creator: Marco Gittler <g.marco@freenet.de>  
copyright: Jakub Ksiezniak  
license: GPL  
URL: [http://public.hronopik.de/vid.stab/](http://public.hronopik.de/vid.stab/)  

## Notes

This filter requires two passes. The first pass performs analysis and stores the result in a file. Upon successful completion of the analysis, the &quot;results&quot; property is updated with the name of the file storing the results. The second pass applies the results to the image.
To use with melt, use &#39;melt ... -consumer xml:output.mlt all=1 real_time=-1&#39; for the first pass. Parallel processing (real_time &lt; -1 or &gt; 1) is not supported for the first pass. For the second pass, use output.mlt as the input.


## Parameters
