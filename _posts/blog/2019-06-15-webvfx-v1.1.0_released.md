You can [download it from GitHub](https://github.com/mltframework/webvfx/releases/tag/1.1.0).

MLT continues to maintain and extend the
[WebVfx](https://github.com/mltframework/webvfx) add-on that lets one use HTML
and Qt QML technologies for a video asset or effects. Back in November, 2018 we
released v1.0.0 as it has proven fairly stable and useful in Shotcut for a few
years. Here are the enhancements for v1.1.0:

* Added support for alpha channels in MLT video for input and output.
* Added a transparent property to the MLT filter. When the property is set to 1, 
this gives a filter a transparent white canvas for drawing while the MLT video
image is still available through the JavaScript extension. This facilitates
using WebVfx to draw the alpha channel independently of the MLT alpha channel.
* Added support for getting a MLT rectangle property (mlt_rect) as a JavaScript
object with properties: x, y, width, height, and opacity.
