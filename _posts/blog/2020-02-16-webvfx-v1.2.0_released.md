You can [download it from GitHub](https://github.com/mltframework/webvfx/releases/tag/1.2.0).

This version adds support for MLT v6.20.0's preview scaling.

For the MLT integration, if the resource starts with "plain:" webvfx does
automatic scaling by changing the zoom level. This works fine for content that
is simply produced or overlayed by the filter. However, content that uses the
webvfx JavaScript extension will not operate with zoom unless the service
property `mlt_resolution_scale` is set to 1. New properties
`mlt_profile_scale_width` and `mlt_profile_scale_height` are real numbers that
reflect the new MLT scale properties used to do low-res preview scaling.
Content script can access this via  `webvfx.getNumberParameter()` to scale its
parameters and elements.
