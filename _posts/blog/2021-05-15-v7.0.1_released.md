You can [download it from GitHub](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/releases/tag/v7.0.1).

This version is just build fixes for the most immediate problems with the
somewhat new but exclusive build system in v7.

* Fixed docker image not working.
* Fixed a system-installed build cannot finds its modules and data.
* Fixed the python installation path for binaries.
* Added support for the `DESTDIR` environment variable when creating melt symlink.
* Increased the build constant for the maximum size of a line of a properties file.
* Fixed the vid.stab metadata install path.
