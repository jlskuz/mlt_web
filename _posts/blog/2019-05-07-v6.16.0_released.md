You can [download it from GitHub](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/releases/tag/v6.16.0).

This version is released to facilitate packaging the latest version of Shotcut,
which is using new APIs.

**Framework**

Added functions to get/set a creation date to a producer:
- `mlt_producer_get_creation_time()`
- `mlt_producer_set_creation_time()`
- `Mlt::Producer::set_creation_time()`
- `Mlt::Producer::get_creation_time()`


**Modules**

* Fixed dance filter not showing when lower track is transparent.
* Refactored dynamictext filter to use `mlt_producer_get_creation_time()`.
* Marked frei0r rgsplit0r plugin version < 1.1 as not thread-safe.
* Fixed possible null pointer crash in `mlt_properties_serialise_yaml()`.
