#### Framework

-   Small, clean API with minimal dependencies (POSIX and C11)
-   Modular design for the addition of new components
-   Simple integration with other multimedia libraries and applications
-   Supports the authoring and manipulation (ala DOM) of time-based
    media including playlists, multiple tracks, filters, and transitions
-   Serialization and deserialization of authored projects
-   Doxygen-based API [Documentation]({{"/docs/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
-   High-level language bindings for C++, C\#, Java, Lua, Perl, PHP,
    Python, Ruby, and TCL
-   Multi-core and GPU processing
-   Cross-platform: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/),
    Windows [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
-   Licensed under the [LGPLv2.1](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html)

#### Modules

-   Integration with many libraries for multimedia including
    -   [FFmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/) for audio/video
        decoding and encoding
    -   [swfdec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swfdec) Flash
        decoder
    -   [WebVfx](https://github.com/mltframework/webvfx)
        for HTML5-based graphics/animation generation
    -   [GTK+](http://www.gtk.org/) and
        [Qt](http://www.qt-project.org/) for image loading and
        text rendering
    -   [LADSPA](http://www.ladspa.org/) audio plugins
    -   [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/Docs/Features) audio
        effects
    -   [libsamplerate](http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/) audio
        resampler
    -   [JACK](http://jackaudio.org/) audio routing
    -   [frei0r](http://www.dyne.org/software/frei0r/) video
        plugins
    -   [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org/) for desktop audio/video
        output
-   Supports nearly all audio and video formats and codecs that
    [FFmpeg does](http://www.ffmpeg.org/general.html) for both input and encoding - many with frame-accurate seeking
-   Supports image sequences in any format that GDK and QImage supports
    including SVG and others with alpha channels
-   Comprehensive and optimized suite of video and audio effects
    including image scaling, alpha-compositing, deinterlacing, masking,
    motion-tracking, audio mixing, audio gain, and wipe transitions - in
    addition to services provided through the above libraries
-   A selection of output targets/profiles including HD
-   An XML authoring schema designed to leverage the full capabilities
    of the system
-   YAML-based metadata and schema for documentation of modules, their
    services, and parameters
-   Live IP [streaming]({{"/faq/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) output via FFmpeg
-   HD SDI with embedded audio and HDMI input and output is available
    for Linux using
    [Blackmagick Design](http://www.blackmagic-design.com/products/) cards and the MLT open source "decklink" module. Also,
    SDI output supports keying (alpha composite MLT output over live
    SDI input).
-   HD SDI output with embedded audio is available for Linux using
    [DVEO VidPort](http://www.dveo.com/broadcast/Single-Channel-HD-SDI-IO-Card.html) cards and MLT fully open source "sdi" module.
-   SD PAL SDI output with embedded audio is available for Linux using [DVEO SDI Master](http://www.dveo.com/broadcast/DVB-PCIe-transmit-receive-cards.shtml) hardware and MLT module now freely available with the
    MLT source code.

    [GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) or
    [LGPLv2.1](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html)
    (configurable at build time, not all modules available under LGPL)

#### Protocol

-   Comprehensive client/server protocol and API for playout scheduling
-   MVCP, based upon work in dv1394d and designed based upon SGI MVCP

#### Applications

-   A playout server with a well defined protocol
-   Sample applications that demonstrate the client/server API
-   A command line video editor and media player
