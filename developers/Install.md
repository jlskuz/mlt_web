(\*) Contains GPL dependencies or code.

### Dependencies

The MLT core is dependent on:

-   a C11 compliant C compiler
-   posix threading (pthread)
-   standard posix libraries (libc)

The MLT applications and libraries provided are all dependent on the
core.

The modules have the following dependencies:

  | *Module* | *Description* |
  | avformat | [FFmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org) or [libav](http://www.libav.org) v0.7 or later |
  | dv | [libdv](http://libdv.sf.net) 0.102 or later |
  | gtk2 | [GTK2](http://www.gtk.org) and associated dependencies |
  | jackrack | [JACK](http://jackaudio.org), [libxml2](http://www.xmlsoft.org/), and ladspa.h |
  | opengl | [Movit](http://git.sesse.net/movit) |
  | qimage | [Qt](http://www.qt-project.org) 4.4 or later |
  | resample | [libsamplerate](http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC) 0.15 or later |
  | sdl | [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org) 1.2 or later |
  | sox | [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net) 13 or later |
  | swfdec | [swfdec](http://github.com/mltframework/swfdec) 0.8 or later |
  | vorbis | [libvorbis](http://www.vorbis.com) 1.0.1 or later |
  | xml | [libxml12](http://www.xmlsoft.org) 2.5 or later |

### Configuration

Configuration is triggered from the top level directory via a
./configure script.

Each source bearing subdirectory shown above have their own configure
script which are called automatically from the top level.

Typically, new modules can be introduced without modification to the
configure script and arguments are accepted and passed through to all
subdirectories.

More information on usage is found by running:
`./configure --help`

Note: This script must be run to register new services after a git clone
or subsequent update.

### Compilation

Makefiles are generated during configuration and these are based on a
per directory template which must be provided by the developer.

### Testing

To execute the MLT tools without installation, or to test a new version
on a system with an already installed MLT version in a Bash shell run:
`source setenv`

Note: This applies to your current shell only and it assumes sh or bash.

### Installation

The install is triggered by running make install from the top level
directory.

The framework produces a single shared object which is installed in
$prefix/lib/ and public header files which are installed in
$prefix/include/mlt/framework and $prefix/include/mlt++.

The modules produce a shared object per module installed to
$prefix/lib/mlt. Also, each module may have support files installed to
$prefix/share/mlt/modules.

For the development of modules and applications, pkg-config metadata
files are generated and installed in $prefix/lib/pkgconfig.

### Development

All compilation in the project has {top-level-dir}/src on the include
path. All headers are included as:

~~~
#include <framework/file.h>
~~~

All external modules have {prefix}/include/mlt on the include path. All
headers should also be included as:

~~~
#include <framework/file.h>
~~~

This allows migration of source between external and internal modules.
The configuration and Makefile template requirements will require
attention though.
